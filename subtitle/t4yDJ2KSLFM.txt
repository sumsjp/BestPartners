as a product manager
How to turn chatgpt into productivity
I personally summed up
The following are very useful features
At this time, you only need to enter your needs
Then let him help you beautify and optimize
looks more professional
Just need to modify it a little bit
Basically, we can get the result we want
what about the test text
We use the project that we completed this week a
followed up on project b
3 issues solved
Followed up 3 users
Let him write a very professional weekly newspaper for me
Let him use this as a template to write
everyone can try
basically
can get an answer that we roughly want
have a preliminary understanding
save us a lot of time
what about the test text
you write like this
Please tell me what IPLC is
like this question-and-answer format
For example, a certain type of requirements document
Outlines of white papers and even PPTs
These can basically give an accuracy of 60% to 80%.
You can basically use it by adding it yourself
We provide a test text
For example, please help me write an article about fresh food e-commerce app
white paper
Then let chat GPT do it for you
The fourth design idea
what does this mean
We need to clarify our needs
let him design
sometimes
He can also give some
some things we can't think of
The test text given at this time is
If I want to design a fresh food e-commerce platform
how should it be designed
It's a big problem, isn't it?
This is the most frequently encountered product writing documentation
often hard to hold back
It's hard to hold back a word
But not big enough
feel very low
Then you send directly to our chat GBT
Let him write it out for you in a more professional grammar
Basically, you can get a good result
The test text we provided at this time is
Our fresh app
Can it be recommended by algorithm
Let users buy more suitable products
Please explain the previous paragraph in detail
and look a little more professional
Then we let chatGPT help us generate
It's really hard not to write code
Basically most of them can't write
For example, we recently had a demand
speech to text
I would like to see the history theme
Can it be solved on the V2 node?
Solved but very few people responded
i want to ask him
He was able to tell me a bunch of things directly
Fairly useful open source project
And can directly write python code
copy into python
Most of them can still run
For someone who doesn't know how to code
is quite friendly
The test text we provide is
I need a support Chinese
And offline voice-to-text service
And help me write examples in python
Look who said that our products do not understand code
Products can also understand code
miraculous test text
Need to shoot a promotional video for a fresh food e-commerce app
need surprise
need to innovate
need professional
Demand for everything you need
you can write in
please follow this request
write a script
What if you don't get the results you want?
can often send
write in more detail
write more awesome
Write more innovatively
basically
got our desired result
I personally think
Most people use this chatGPT
What about this function?
May be a bit biased in thinking
why do you say that
You always ask him the truth of life
Ask him math problems in junior high school
Let him be a chicken and a rabbit in the same cage
let him do this analytic geometry
even make him do some super complicated things
What about physics?
topic he sure
It's not good at this logical reasoning.
so in my eyes
he is not a decision tool
It is not a question making tool
I think it's more of an inspiration tool
Broaden your horizons in your day-to-day work
provide some new ideas
And some things to solve some boring repetition
For example, we often write in the workplace
Workplace Eight Ancient Prose
wait wait these
The main purpose is to use
A great improvement in work efficiency, what about the above
some of my own thoughts
It's a throwaway
